Hello,

the Makefile.PL distributed with DBD::TSM 0.01 enters an infinite loop 
when no terminal is connected to give input, thus eating CPU ressources 
when the module is installed unattended. The Makefile.PL should instead 
bail out when it finds no terminal connected and can't find a 
proper/fitting directory itself.

Thank you,
-max

* RESPONSE:
Right, I do not think about silent use of my Makefile.PL. I do a correction to improve this point.
